To implement the requirements using a microcontroller, here is a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Set Threshold Value for LDR Using Keypad:
- Use the keypad to input and set the threshold value for the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The value entered through the keypad will be the threshold for the LDR sensor.

### 2. Read the LDR Value Using ADC Channel 0:
- Connect the LDR sensor to an analog pin (ADC Channel 0) on the microcontroller.
- Read the analog voltage using the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) module.

### 3. Display the Percentage of Light on the LCD:
- Map the ADC readings to a percentage scale to represent the light intensity.
- Display this percentage on an LCD connected to the microcontroller.

### 4. Adapt Room Temperature Using PWM and LED:
- If the light intensity is above the set threshold:
  - Control a PWM-driven LED to adjust the room temperature.
  - For instance, increase the LED's brightness using PWM to mimic heating or cooling processes.

### Implementation Notes:
- Ensure proper interfacing of the keypad, LDR sensor, ADC, LCD, and PWM module with the microcontroller.
- Design a mapping function to convert ADC readings to a percentage for the display.
- The PWM duty cycle can be adjusted according to the light intensity to manage the LED brightness, simulating room temperature adjustment.

This implementation involves integrating multiple components like the keypad, LDR sensor, ADC, LCD, and PWM module with the microcontroller. Accurate integration, calibration, and proper data handling are crucial for successful execution.

Please note that the specifics may vary depending on the microcontroller, the interface used, and the components' characteristics. For the most accurate and efficient implementation, you may need to consult the datasheets and technical documentation of the components and the microcontroller you are using.
